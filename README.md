Project's Name: Premier League

About: I have based my project on the Premier League. I planned to create a clear, easy and well structured wedsite on the English Premier League.
I will use big fonts sizes, clear links to relivant pages ie teams official websites.  I am going to use a colour palette of nice bright blues.
The main reason for the Project is to develope a site that is useful and easy to navigate for people who are not tech savvy.

UX:

STEP 1: The first thing i did before i even looked at a laptop, i went and asked some people(not tech savvy) that i thought would be kean users.
I asked one simple Question. Do you find it easy to locate information about the Premier League online.

Name: Philip O'Reilly Age: 71
Answer: No
Quote: "The Premier League website has way too much going on and i find it very confusing and time consuming"

Name: Johnny O'Reilly Age: 88
Answer: "On what line"

Name: Lucas O'Reilly Age: 8
Answer: No
Quote: "Every time i go on to Premier League.com i clicked on something by accident and then i go to a different site"

STEP 2: I then made a wireframe of my planned site. After alot of planning and alot of  wireframes i finally create a 
wireframe that i was happy with (with the help of my potential users) 

STEP 3: I did some research on the Premier League and its online users.
The Premier League is the top division of English football. The Premier League is the most watched sports league in the world.
Broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential tv audience of 4.7 billion people.
It also has countless online users looking for information 24/7 on the Premier League in every corner of the internet.

Some of the Premier League online users numbers:

Premier League's Facebook has over 44.5 million followers.
Premier League's Twitter has over 22.1 followers.
Premier League's Youtube has 996K subscribers and counting.

Even with all these resources my father found it very difficult to get easy, clear and useful information on the Premier League.
A Quote from my father: "The Premier League website has way too much going on and i find it very confusing and time consuming"

STEP 4: I went back to my potential users and asked them what informatiom they want to find on the Premier League?

Name: Philip O'Reilly Age: 71
Answer: "To find the clubs official website easily because their is so many different Liverpool sites"

Name: Johnny O'Reilly Age: 87
Answer: "History of the Premier League"

Name: Lucas O'Reilly Age: 8
Answer: " What teams are in it and where are they from" 

STEP 5: After the answer giving from my potential users i picked my features that would accmmodate their needs.

STEP 6: I picked my colour palette font sizes.

STEP 7: I found all the images that i planned to use in my website.

STEP 8: i located all the relivant links to the teams official websites .

STEP 9: Finally I picked the API'S that i wanted to use.

Features:

Nav Bar: My Nar bar has 4 links to Home, News, Tickets and History.
I added the font awesome class of hvr-bounce-to-bottom so that you can clearly see which link you are on.
The reason i used hvr-bounce-to-bottom was because it looks like a bouncing football.(On every page)

Footer:  I added 3 link to the Premier League Facebook, Twitter and Youtube in my footer and used the font awesome 
class hvr-bounce-to-top also because its clear to see.(On every page)

Google Map: On my home page i used the Google maps API to display the 20 teams in the Premier league on a map of England.
When a user clicks on a team crest an info window will pop up with that teams stadium infomatiom.

Table on the Home page: I added a table to display the teams of the Premier League and made the crests a link to that 
team official website.

Email on the Tickets Page: I put an email form for users to enquire about tickets for matchs.

Table on the History page: I added another table on the History page to display the winners of the Premier League through the years.
I made the crests into links to information and stats of that years season.




Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
